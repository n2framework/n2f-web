					<h2>Where To Start</h2>
					<div class="main-content">
						So you've got everything installed and you're ready to build the next eBay, but you're new to our framework.
						We built N2F with people like you in mind and have tried very hard to keep things powerful but simple for
						you to use within our system.  To get started, we would suggest doing the following things to acquaint
						yourself with our framework, as well as start on the path to building your new site or application:
						<ol>
							<li>
								<strong>Get The Lay of The Land</strong> - Start looking through the four modules included with
								the default installation.  You'll need to know the directory structure required for working
								inside of N2F Yverdon and this will show you how we who created the system intended for things
								to come together.  You should have the following modules installed in the '<em>modules</em>'
								directory of your site:
								<ul>
									<li><em>error</em> - This module is a required module that catches any serious errors the system encounters.</li>
									<li><em>main</em> - This is another required module that catches users when they first visit your site.</li>
									<li><em>resources</em> - This is a module we added to link you to some important resources for N2F Yverdon</li>
									<li><em>wheretostart</em> - That's this module!</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Visit The <a href="./?nmod=resources">Resources</a></strong> - One of the things we have wanted to do from the beginning
								is enable people like you to work within a community and help each other.  Most of the resources
								you see listed are places where you can connect with other N2F users as well as the N2F developers
								themselves.  Visit these places and don't <strong>ever</strong> be shy about asking a question.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Create A Simple Module</strong> - By this point, you should understand enough of the system
								to be able to create a simple module which displays a template to the user.  Give it a whirl!
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Have Fun!</strong> - Let loose on our system, push it to it's limits and further if you can.  If
								you find a bug, let us know through our website so we can look into it, and never ever forget to use your
								resources in the community.  Good luck!
							</li>
						</ol>
